#### OS 
- Most important part of software
- Enables communication between software and hardware
- Resource allocation
- 3 key features
	- **Multi-user** - Allows multiple users to use the same computer at the same time
	- **Multi-processing** - OS capable of utilising more than one computer core
	- **Multi-tasking** - OS capable of running multiple software processes at the same time

#### Philosophy of UNIX
1. Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new "features".
2. Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program. Don't clutter output with extraneous information.
3. Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks. Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.
4. Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task, even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you've finished using them.
