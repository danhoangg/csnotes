- Lots of problems involve searching
- Usually a trade-off of
	- Speed
	- Memory
	- Optimality


#### Single-state problem formulation
1. Initial state
2. Actions, or successor function
3. Goal test
	1. Explicit, e.g. x = "at Bucharest"
	2. Implicit, e.g. Checkmate(x)
4. Path cost (additive)

#### Solutions to searching a tree of decisions
- DFS
- BFS
