- Requirement gathering takes several iterations
- Methodical rather than technical

### Definition and Scope
- **Need** - What problem does it solve, what needs are satisfied?
- **Goals** - What is its intended purpose? What functionality will it provide?
- **Business case** - How it makes money/ improves life?
- **Stakeholders** - Any person or group who will be affected by the system, directly or indirectly
- **High-level operational concepts** - High-level view of how the system will be used
- **Success criteria** - How we measure success?

**Scoping Philosophies**
- **Traditional** - Scope should remain fixed
- **Agile** - Scope may change, like it or not, many times for reasons out of your control


#### Requirements

**Functional**
- What the system must do
- Interactions between system and users and between system and other systems
**Non-Functional**
- How 'well' the system does what it must
	- How fast
	- How easy to use
	- How easy to evolve
**Design**
- How the system should be implemented
**Implementation**
- Use of specific tools, languages or platforms
**Interface**
- Constraints imposed by external systems
**Legal**

#### What makes a good specification?

- **Unambiguous**
	- A requirement cannot be interpreted in mutually exclusive ways
- **Correct**
	- Accurate representation of what the client wants and what the developer will build
- **Verifiability**
	- Correctness can be demonstrated with repeatable tests
- **Traceability**
	- Requirements can be traced to other artifacts in the system
